/**
 * This package contains a first garbage collection implementation for the Dolphin Platform model.
 * As defined by {@link com.canoo.dolphin.server.DolphinModel} and {@link com.canoo.dolphin.mapping.DolphinBean} each
 * Dolphin Platform model is a hierarchy of several Dolphin Platform beans. All the beans will automatically be synchronized
 * between server and client. To do so the remoting layer holds a representation of each Dolphin Platform Bean.
 * When the server controller removes a bean out of the hierarchy the garbage collection should notice this and automatically
 * remove the bean representation from the remoting layer. By doing so the bean will automatically be deleted on the client.
 * How a bean can be created and removed is defined by the {@link com.canoo.dolphin.BeanManager}. by using the garbage collection
 * an application developer doesn't need to call {@link com.canoo.dolphin.BeanManager#remove(Object)} anymore.
 *
 * The current version of the garbage collections don't allow cycles in references.
