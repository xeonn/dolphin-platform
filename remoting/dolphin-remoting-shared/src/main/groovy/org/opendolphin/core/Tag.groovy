/**
 * Tags are used to differentiate various data and metadata associated with an Attribute.
 * Every attribute has a tag; by default, the VALUE tag is used.
 * <p/>
 * By creating multiple attributes with the same property name but different tags, any amount of metadata can be kept
 * for the property.  This metadata can consist of any additional information that the view layer might find useful,
 * for example, the localized label to be displayed next to the property, the tooltip for the property, validation
 * criteria for the property, whether the UI control for the property should be visible or enabled, and so on.
 * <p/>
 * Note that Dolphin itself does not take any special action based on the tag type, except to assume a tag type of VALUE
 * if none is otherwise specified.  The view code must supply the logic to enforce tag meanings.
 * Therefore, additional tags may be created as needed with no change to Dolphin itself.
 * The UI toolkit can bind against these other tag attributes just as it can against the "value" attribute.
 * <p/>
 * Tags are essentially statically typed Strings, and you can make your own by using the "tagFor" factory or
 * by subclassing.
 * <p/>
 * Several tags are predeclared; see documentation for suggested usage.
 * @see Attribute
