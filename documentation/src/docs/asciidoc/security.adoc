= Security

The Dolphin Platform do not provide its own security concept but can easily be
combined with any security framework. To do so the client API of the Dolphin
Platform provides access to the http connection. Based on this it's quite easy
to enrich the http requests of the Dolphin Platform with additional information
like a JWT token.

== Provide Security in a Java based client

When using a Java client API of the Dolphin Platform (like JavaFX or Android)
the configuration provides the functionality to define a custom http connection
factory and a http response handler. Based on this a developer can implement any
custom security mechanism for the Dolphin Platform.

All http connections that will be used by the Dolphin Platform are created by
the `HttpURLConnectionFactory` instance that is provided by the client configuration.
A developer can easily provide a custom implementation of the `HttpURLConnectionFactory`
interface and add this to the client configuration:

[source,java]
----
HttpURLConnectionFactory myFactory = url -> {
    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.connect();
    connection.setRequestProperty("Security-Header", "My secret token");
    return connection;
}

ClientConfiguration configuration = new JavaFXConfiguration(serverEndpoint);
configuration.setConnectionFactory(myFactory);
----

Next to this a response handler can be implemented to extract needed information of
the server response. A custom response handler will be called after the Dolphin
Platform client API has handled the response. To provide such a handler a
developer need to provide a custom implementation of the
`HttpURLConnectionResponseHandler` interface:

[source,java]
----
HttpURLConnectionResponseHandler myhandler = response -> {
    String mySecurityToken = response.getHeaderField("Security-Header");
    MySecurityManager.setToken(mySecurityToken);
}

ClientConfiguration configuration = new JavaFXConfiguration(serverEndpoint);
configuration.setResponseHandler(myhandler);
----

Next to this the Dolphin Platform internally uses a cookie store to handle the
session cookie of the current client session. If a developer needs a specific
cookie store or wants to add some custom cookies to the http requests of the
Dolphin Platform the cookie store that will be used by the Dolphin Platform
client can be defined by the client configuration:

----
CookieStore mySpecialCookieStore = MySecurityManager.getCookieStore();

ClientConfiguration configuration = new JavaFXConfiguration(serverEndpoint);
configuration.setCookieStore(mySpecialCookieStore);
----

TIP: The Dolphin Platform offers its own implementations of the interfaces
and configurations that are described in this chapter. The `ClientConfiguration` class
already provides them as a default configuration. For more information a developer can
have a look at `DefaultHttpURLConnectionFactory` and `DefaultHttpURLConnectionResponseHandler`.
