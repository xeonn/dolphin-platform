= JavaFX client API

When creating a JavaFX client you will normally use FXML to create your view. Next to the FXML file you will have a view
controller to bind all the properties of the view and attach action handlers.

When talking about the Dolphin Platform, this view controller is the perfect point to bind the view to the synchronized
model and the server side controller. Therefore we call this class the "Binder". There are several ways how you can
define such a binding but the most easy one is to extend the `AbstractViewBinder` class that is part of the Dolphin Platform
JavaFX library. This class already implements the complete lifecycle of the view and you can simply bind the
synchronized presentation model to your view properties. Here is a small example for a view that contains only one
textfield and a button:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBinder extends AbstractViewBinder<MyModel> {

  @FXML
  private Button button;

  @FXML
  private TextField textfield;

  public MyBinder(ClientContext clientContext) {
    super(clientContext, ControllerConstants.NAME);
  }

  @Override
  public void init() {
    FXBinder.bind(textfield.textProperty()).bidirectionalTo(getModel().nameProperty());
    button.setOnAction(e -> invoke(ControllerConstants.SAVE));
  }

  @Override
  public Node getRootNode() {
    return null;
  }

}
----

Once the view binder is instantiated, the server controller and the model will automatically be created on the server.
Since the model will be synchronized all the time between client and server you don't need to create it on the client.
After this initialization is done the init() method of the binder will be called. With this we bind the name property
that is part of the synchronized model to the text property of the textfield. In addition, we define an action handler
for the button. When the button is pressed an action in the server side controller should be called. To do so the
abstract binder provides the invoke(String name) method that triggers actions on the server controller. In this specific
case the server controller might look like this:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinController(ControllerConstants.NAME)
public class Controller {

  @Inject
  private PersistenceService persistence;

  @DolphinModel
  private MyModel model;

  @DolphinAction(ControllerConstants.SAVE)
  public void save() {
    persistence.insert(model.getName());
  }

}
----

As you can see we never send any data to the server. Since the model will be automatically synchronized, we can directly
store the name string in the model to the database. The Dolphin Platform guarantees that the model will be the same as
it's on the client when pressing the button.

Another nice benefit that you might notice is that even if we have communication between the server and the client we
don't need to handle several threads. The Dolphin Platform handles all the concurrency and handles all actions in the
right thread. Therefore, the binding between JavaFX properties and Dolphin properties will automatically be handled on
the JavaFX application thread.
