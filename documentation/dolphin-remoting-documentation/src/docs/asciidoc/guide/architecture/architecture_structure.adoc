*Modules define the vertical structure*

Dolphin consists of three parts:

. the shared module
. the client module
. the server module

Both, client and server depend on the shared module.

There is an additional fourth module called "combined", which
depends on all three modules above and allows combining them in one single
Java virtual machine for automatic testing, debugging, profiling and demo purposes.

All modules live in their own subproject with a separate source tree
and the Gradle build system is
used to build them according to their dependency structure.

Each project that uses Dolphin will most likely resemble this structure
where the shared module may be empty (in case they is no shared knowledge
between client and server).

The Dolphin team has produced a link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart[JumpStartProject]
that suggests a best-practice project setup for Dolphin-enabled applications, either with

* a Maven build or
* a Gradle build.

Dolphin itself comes with a substantial list of demos in the subproject "demo-javafx".
It is highly recommended to have a look at the demos in order to understand
how we expect Dolphin to be used.

*The horizontal layering*

Orthogonally to the vertical structure of modules, there is a simple horizontal
layering that spans across all modules. In consists of:

* the common infrastructure for build automation, configurations, etc.
* the communication layer that provides the basic implementation
* the facade layer that provides the API
* the demo layer that shows all Dolphin features in small examples

The layering is visible through the respective package structure.

WARNING: The application programmer should only use the facade layer.

The figure below summarizes the vertical and horizontal structuring

While the structural part of the Dolphin architecture is rather
obvious and straight-forward, the concepts and rules that stand behind
its inception require a bit of explanation, which is the topic of the next section.
