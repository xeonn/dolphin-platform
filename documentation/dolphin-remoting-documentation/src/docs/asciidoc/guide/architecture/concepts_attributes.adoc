Each presentation model can refer to many attributes.

Attributes maintain a back-reference to their one and only presentation model.

Attributes are _generic._ You never need implement your own attribute type.

Each attribute has a unique *id* and a *propertyName* that is unique per presentation model.

Attributes encapsulate a primitive value and allow listeners to be notified about value changes.
Technically, this is done via the standard Java *PropertyChangeListener* type.
In other words, attributes are *Observable*.

In addition to the value, attributes provide more information about the value, i.e
whether the value is _dirty_ (i.e. it differs from the _base value_).
The dirty state is observable such that you can bind against it.
As soon as at least one attribute of a presentation model is dirty, that presentation
model is also considered dirty.

Attributes have an optional _qualifier_ property to capture the fact that this attribute
represents a qualified feature in the domain world.
A qualifier like "person.4711.firstName" may be used to explain that this attribute
represents the value of the *firstName* property of *Person* domain class with id 4711.

Whenever the value of an Attribute changes, all other attributes with the same qualifier
are automatically updated.

Qualifiers are a prerequisite for <<Stable bindings>>

Since version 0.4 Dolphin attributes can be tagged in order to describe the meaning of
the value. The *Tag* enumeration provides all possible tags with *VALUE* being the default.
Tags can be used to i.e. describe whether the person firstname is a *MANDATORY* attribute,
whether it is *ENABLED*, *VISIBLE*, and so on.
Attributes with a tag are observable in the usual way.
