= JavaEE Integration

Even if mostly all of the public server APIs of the Dolphin Platform don't depend on the underlying container
implementation a special dependency must be added to a project that is created as a JavaEE based application.

.Dependencies for a JavaEE based server

The `dolphin-platform-server-javaee` dependency adds the Dolphin Platform server API and JavaEE APIs as transitive
dependencies. For a maven based project a minimum  `pom.xml` looks like this:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.canoo.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>server</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>dolphin-platform-server-javaee</artifactId>
            <version>{dolphin-platform-version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

</project>
----

In most cases you will define the model classes in a separate module that is shared between client and server and server
must be added as a second dependency to your application.
Once you start the server application the Dolphin Platform bootstrap will automatically be initialized.

== Configuration of the application

The Dolphin Platform part of the application can be configured a `dolphin.properties` file. This file is not JavaEE
specific and therefore it's described in the general server part.

== Next steps

When developing a Dolphin Platform application with JavaEE you can use all the benefits of both worlds. This means that
you can simply define CDI beans and inject them in Dolphin Platform controllers. A general overview of the Dolphin
Platform server API can be found here.

== Using the jumpstart

Dolphin Platform provides several Maven archetypes to quickly create a full client server application. By doing so you
only need an installed Maven on your system and can run the following command on a shell:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.canoo.dolphin-platform:
----

This will start a Maven build that creates a full client-server Maven project for you. A full documentation of the
jumpstart can be found here.
