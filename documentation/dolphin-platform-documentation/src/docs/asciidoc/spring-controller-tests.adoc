= Spring controller tests

The Dolphin Platform provides a test framework to write unit tests for Dolphin Platform controllers. For
Spring the Dolphin Platform offer some abstract test classes that can be extended to write custom tests
for controllers. Tests can be written by using TestNG or JUnit.


== Testing a controller

When writing a unit tests for a controller Spring automatically manages the controller and provides a
facade to interact with the controller and test its behavior. To do so the Dolphin Platform contains
the interface `ControllerUnderTest` that provides access to the controller. By using this interface you
can call actions on the controller, access the model and destroy the controller. This interface is independent
of the container and test framework and therefore it's used in all controller tests.
The concrete test implementation defines hoe instances of the `ControllerUnderTest` interface will be created
but once you have created your instance writing a test is quite easy:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void test1 {
    ControllerUnderTest<MyModel> controllerProxy = ... // We will see later how to create it
    MyModel model = controllerProxy.getModel();
    model.setTitle("Any title");
    controllerProxy.invoke(RESET_VALUES);
    Assert.assertEquals(model.getTitle(), "");
    controllerProxy.destroy();
}
----

As you can see in this small example you can write controller tests like you write the view of a controller.
The biggest difference is, that you use a test framework like JUnit or TestNG to define some assertions for
the controller or its model.


== Destroying a controller

At the end of each test you should destroy the controller that was tested. The `ControllerUnderTest` interface provides
a `destroy()` method that must be called to destroy the controller. Like in the real application the controller and
its lifecycle is managed by Spring. This means that methods that are annotated with `@PostConstruct` or `@PreDestroy` will
be called automatically. When calling the `destroy()` method Spring will destroy the controller and automatically call
methods that are annotated with `@PreDestroy`. In the given example the `destroy()` method is already called at the end
of the test. Test frameworks like JUnit or TestNG provide features to automatically call such a method after each test.


== Proving a testable controller

The Dolphin Platform provides the `ControllerTest` interface that should be implemented by each test class. This
interface provides a method to create new `ControllerUnderTest` instances. For Spring the Dolphin Platform already
contains an implementation of the interface that can easily be used to write tests for your controllers. By using the
`ControllerTest` interface a test method will look like this:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void test1 {
    ControllerUnderTest<MyModel> controllerProxy = createController(MY_CONTROLLER);
    MyModel model = controllerProxy.getModel();
    model.setTitle("Any title");
    controllerProxy.invoke(RESET_VALUES);
    Assert.assertEquals(model.getTitle(), "");
    controllerProxy.destroy();
}
----


== Testing a controller in Spring

If you write your server application based on Spring you want to use Spring as a container to run your tests, too.
Normally you have defined some services or components that are injected in your controllers since the Dolphin Platform
provides full support of the DI features of Spring. When writing a test you want all the services to be automatically
injected. Spring provides some specific test classes for this purpose and based on the Spring classes the Dolphin
Platform offers some more specific test classes that contains everything you need to write tests for controllers:

* If you want to use JUnit to write your controller tests your test classes should extend `SpringJUnitControllerTest`
* If you want to use TestNG to write your controller tests your test classes should extend `SpringTestNGControllerTest`


=== JUnit controller test in Spring

As already said a test class should extend the `SpringJUnitControllerTest` class. By doing so a first simple test class
will look like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyControllerTest extends SpringJUnitControllerTest {

    @Test
    public void test1 {
        ControllerUnderTest<MyModel> controllerProxy = createController(MY_CONTROLLER);
        MyModel model = controllerProxy.getModel();
        model.setTitle("Any title");
        controllerProxy.invoke(RESET_VALUES);
        Assert.assertEquals(model.getTitle(), "");
        controllerProxy.destroy();
    }

}
----

Normally you will write one test class for each controller type. In addition this class will contain more than 1
method to test the controller. By doing so you can use some of the annotations that are provided by JUnit to write
a readable and maintainable testclass:

----
public class MyControllerTest extends SpringJUnitControllerTest {

    private ControllerUnderTest<MyModel> controllerProxy;

    private MyModel model;

    @Before
    public void init() {
        controllerProxy = createController(MY_CONTROLLER);
        model = controllerProxy.getModel();
    }

    @After
    public void destroy() {
        controllerProxy.destroy();
    }


    @Test
    public void test1 {
        model.setTitle("Any title");
        controllerProxy.invoke(RESET_VALUES);
        Assert.assertEquals(model.getTitle(), "");
    }

    @Test
    public void test2 {
        model.setTitle("Any title");
        controllerProxy.invoke(SHOW_DEFAULTS);
        Assert.assertEquals(model.getTitle(), "Default");
    }

}
----

In this case a new `ControllerUnderTest` instance is created for each test and will be destroyed directly after the
test. By doing so a developer don't need to handle this in each test.
